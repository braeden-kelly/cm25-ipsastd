    <h1>Choose your Adventure</h1>

    <p>
        You are a developer on a Service Provider App which exposes several REST API endpoints that is deployed to a Kubernetes test environment.  
        Your REST APIs also have an Apigee Proxy that is a pass through to your app in kubernetes.  The Apigee Proxy handles normal items like logging and OAUTH validation.  
        You've recently deployed a new V2 version of your REST API which adds a few new fields, which are required, to some requests and updated responses compared to the V1 services which is still available.
